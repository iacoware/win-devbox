Other things to install/remeber (not everything is automated)

- choco must run in an admin console
- install testdriven.net

- configure conemu to start inside a predefined shell

- If it's running inside VMWare (as I usually do)
	* Optimize for perf
	* Change when the computer go to sleep to 'never'
	* To obtain CMD+Click VMware -> Preferences -> Mouse & Keyboard -> Button 3 checked
	* Use Autohotkey script to tame windows key bindings (see support)
